	/// would be, and AppKit treats it as ordinary content: double-clicking it did nothing. Controls
	/// inside the view keep their clicks; only what falls through to the background is handled.

	/// SwiftUI gestures, not an `NSView` overriding `mouseDown`: the hosting view routes clicks
	/// itself and reached a background `NSView` only over part of the header.
